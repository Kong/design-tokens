A **Style Dictionary** is a build system that allows you to define styles once, in a way for any platform or language to consume. A single place to create and edit your styles, and a single command exports these rules to all the places you need them - iOS, Android, CSS, JS, HTML, sketch files, style documentation, or anything you can think of.

## Committing Changes

[![Commitizen friendly](https://img.shields.io/badge/commitizen-friendly-brightgreen.svg)](http://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/)

This repo uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

[Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) and [Commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) are used to help build and enforce commit messages.

It is __highly recommended__ to use the following command in order to create your commits:

```sh
yarn commit
```

This will trigger the Commitizen interactive prompt for building your commit message.

### Enforcing Commit Format

[Lefthook](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook) is used to manage Git Hooks within the repo. A `commit-msg` hook is automatically setup that enforces commit message stands with `commitlint`, see [`lefthook.yml`](./lefthook.yml).
